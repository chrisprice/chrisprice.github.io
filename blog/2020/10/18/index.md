Scaffold board patio steps

# Scaffold board patio steps

A half-day project to build some patio steps from some recycled scaffolding boards from [Newcastle Wood Recycling CIC](https://www.welovewood.org/). Also known as we love wood, I would thoroughly recommend their products, ethos and sense of humour.

## Constraints

The steps had to -

* Accomodate the slope of the patio. This runs parallel to the back of the house to allow the rain to drain away.
* Be made from scaffolding boards. In all honesty, I was feeling hipster but I also figured they'd last a while outdoors.
* Last a while outdoors. Even though the boards were relatively cheap, I didn't want to be re-making them yearly. 
* Have the "right" depth. I wanted the step to be deep enough that you could easily put your foot on it, but not so deep that it required you to place both feet on it. That description is rubbish but hopefully it makes sense.
* Feel chunky. To match the chunkiness of the scaffolding boards.

## Design

This is the design I came up with. I've no idea why I chose to take a photo of my laptop screen.

You can just about see the construction in the image. There's 3 vertical supports internally which form the feet you can see poking out the bottom. Each of these were to be cut to the right height to accomodate the slope. The horizontal boards then lie on top of these, forming the structure of the step. The boards around the outside are essentially cladding which also add a bit of rigidity. The whole thing would be held together using decking screws.

You can see my indecision in getting the depth "right". In the end, I laid the boards out in situ once I had them and tried walking on them. The 2 board design on the right just felt more "right" so I went with that.

## What would I do differently?

Nothing actually. This is one of the very few projects that hasn't left any sense of instant or steadily accumulating regret. They've held up well for 2 years now and show no real signs of wear.
